Add a splash of water if you need to, to make it a consistency that can be drizzled, then pour into a bowl or jug and chill until needed.\n\n2. To make the fish, whisk the lime juice, oil and fajita seasoning in a bowl, add the cod and toss well. Fry the cod in a non-stick frying pan over a high heat for 5 mins until beginning to flake, but not falling apart. Divide between the tortillas, each one drizzled with the sauce and topped with a spoonful of our curtido and our tomatillo salsa..\n\n",
