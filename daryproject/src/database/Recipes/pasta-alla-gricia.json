        "directions": "1. Cut the guanciale into larger pieces (2x1cm), which we put in a pot or deep pan with olive oil and start heating together on a medium flame. Roast slowly for about 10 minutes..\n\n2. Pour the pasta into the boiling water (we will use less water than usual to get a more starchy water for soaking). We do not add salt to the water - guanciale is salty enough. Cook the pasta al dente and drain to capture all the water.\n\n3. Remove the fried lobe from the pot, pour the released fat into a measuring cup and return only about a teaspoon of fat back to the pot. To this, add about half a liter of pasta water, add black pepper and cook everything together on the strongest flame until the sauce is reduced to about half (5-7 minutes).",
